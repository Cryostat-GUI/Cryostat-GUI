"""
Utility module for the Cryostat GUI


Classes:
    AbstractThread: a class which sets up QT's QThread instance, as well as the assertion signal

    AbstractLoopThread: a thread-class, inheriting from AbstractThread,
        which implements Thread-Loop behaviour, continuously running the class method self.running

    AbstractEventhandlingThread: a thread class, inheriting from AbstractThread,
        which is designed to be used for handling signal-events, not continuous loops

    Window_ui: a window class, which loads the UI definitions from a spcified .ui file,
        emits a signal upon closing
