# Cryostat-GUI
Software to control a Cryostat, as well as measuring devices


## Status
In constant development - use at your own risk!

#### Sequence Editor 
There is a Sequence editor, which was moved to https://github.com/bklebel/measureSequences/. 
It can read PPMS (resistivity option) sequence files - and run them, in an abstract way. Here, we use this "Sequence runner". 


## Contributing
Additional control features and GUI enhancements are welcome, see the various issues, and the bug-tracker project - instrument drivers are better built into https://github.com/pymeasure/pymeasure.
