            With Front Autozero for the front-end amplifier enabled (which is the default setting), the
            Model 2182 performs two A/D measurement cycles for each reading. The first one is a normal
            measurement cycle, and the second one is performed with the polarity of the amplifier reversed.
            This two-cycle, polarity-reversal measurement technique is used to cancel internal offsets in the
            amplifier. With Front Autozero disabled, the second A/D measurement cycle is not performed.

            For Front Autozero:
                :SYSTem SYSTem Subsystem:

            When Autozero for the second amplifier is disabled, the offset, gain, and internal reference
            temperature measurements are not performed. This increases measurement speed (a few % at 1PLC).
            However, the zero, gain, and temperature reference points will eventually drift resulting in
            inaccurate readings for the input signal. It is recommended that Autozero only be disabled for
            short periods of time.
            When Autozero is enabled after being off for a long period of time, the internal reference points
            will not be updated immediately. This will initially result in inaccurate measurements, especially
            if the ambient temperature has changed by several degrees. A faster update of reference points
            can be forced by setting a faster integration rate.

            is required. Note that the AUTO key has no effect on temperature (TEMP1 and TEMP2).

            There are two ACAL options. FULL ACAL calibrates the 10mV and 100V ranges, while

            100V range, it is recommended that you only perform LOW-LVL ACAL.
            The message “ACAL” will be displayed while calibration is in process.
            It takes around five minutes to complete LOW-LVL ACAL and a little more than five
